Project work in the Digital Factory at HS Emden Leer to provide a service that moves workpieces from one location to another on demand. For the implementation, a UR5e is used that moves the workpieces in a pick and place program and reacts to information that are transferred to it via OPC UA.

This project contains the documentation of the student research project, CAD models for parts produced in the project, the program code for the OPC UA server/client (Python, opcua-asyncio) and the robot code (URP).
